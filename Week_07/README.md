### Week 7 code examples

**ProjectWithSecurity**

Visual Studio web service project, with security.  

Study the "ATTENTION" comment tokens as you go through the class notes.  

Open the EntityBodyData.txt source code file for examples of data package format that you can send to the web service. Please note that the user accounts in that file have already been created (so if you attempt to create them again, an error will be returned).  

Features:
* Simple non-enhanced web service project with security
* An "AuthInfo" controller that will return access token data (if you are authenticated)
